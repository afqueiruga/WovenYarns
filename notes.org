** Profiler
This is how I execute line-profiler. The problem was that there are two fucking versions on my system!
Things I need to do:
1) Get rid of the embed
2) Uncomment out the @profile in the march() routines

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  python /Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/kernprof.py -l programs/engineering_tests/rk_all_test.py
 /usr/bin/python -m line_profiler rk_all_test.py.lprof
